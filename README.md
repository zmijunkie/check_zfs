# check_zfs
check_zfs - an extension for nagios/nrpe - works for me on FreeBSD11

Found the original at

https://exchange.nagios.org/directory/Plugins/Operating-Systems/Solaris/check_zfs/details

and a remix

https://karlsbakk.net/nagios/check_zfs

So I changed karlsbakk.net's version so it works for me on FreeBSD11.
